Hey! So, I was in school learning math, and it hit me: I could totally make life easier with a little coding magic. As luck would have it, I'm also a web developer, so I whipped up this sweet toolbox. It's my way of making stats and number crunching a piece of cake.

This is an open-source toolbox I made during my free time, meant to simplify statistical calculations and give data enthusiasts, students, and anyone else a helping hand. It's a quick little project I put together because I wanted an easier way to work with data, and I thought you might too!

## Features
