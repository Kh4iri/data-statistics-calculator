This is an open-source tool I whipped up during my free time, meant to simplify statistical calculations and give data enthusiasts, students, and anyone else a helping hand. It's a quick little project I put together because I wanted an easier way to work with data, and I thought you might too!

## Features
- **Mean**: Calculate the average value of your dataset.
- **Median**: Find the middle value (50th percentile) of your data.
- **Mode**: Identify the most frequently occurring value in your dataset.
- **Quartile**: Compute quartile values (Q1, Q2, Q3) to understand data distribution.
- **Decile**: Calculate deciles (D1 to D9) to analyze percentiles.

In addition to these core features, this website throws in some extra goodies, including:

- **Sorted Data**: Access your data in sorted order.
- **Data Count**: Get to know how many data you have.
- **Sum**: Quickly find the sum of all data points.
- **Min**: The minimum value in your data.
- **Max**: The maximum value in your data.
